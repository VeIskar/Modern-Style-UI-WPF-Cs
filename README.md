# Modern-Style-UI-WPF-Cs

This project showcases a modern, flat design user interface (UI) created using WPF and C#. The UI design was supposed to be simple and minimalistic, but at the same time present a futuristic look. I utilizied AI-generated images and free resources to achieve some of the design parts.

## Features

Current features are:

1. **Flat Design :** The UI employs a flat design approach, providing a sleek and modern appearance.

2. **Multiple Views:** The project includes three distinct views:

    - **Overview view:** This view demonstrates a basic modern UI layout.

    - **Browse view:** Building upon the first view, this showcases the integration of AI-generated images to enhance the futuristic feel.

    - **News View:** The News View presents an image slider and clock in the upper left corner, creating an engaging user experience.

3. **Image "News" Slider:** The News View incorporates an image slider that displays a series of images with different description to simulate news bar. Users can navigate through the images using intuitive buttons.

4. Tags Bar: The cosmetic "tags" bar provides a visual representation of tags associated with the content. (Note: This feature is currently mostly cosmetical.)
