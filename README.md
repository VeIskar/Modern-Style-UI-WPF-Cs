# Modern-Style-UI-WPF-Cs
This project showcases a modern, flat design user interface (UI) created using WPF and C#. 
The UI design was supposed to be simple and minimalistic, but at the same time present a futuristic look. I utilizied AI-generated images and free resources to achieve some of the design parts.

Features
Current features are:

Flat Design: The UI employs a flat design approach, providing a sleek and modern appearance.

Multiple Views: The project includes three distinct views:

Overview view: This view demonstrates a basic modern UI layout.
Browse view: Building upon the first view, this showcases the integration of AI-generated images to enhance the futuristic feel.
News View: The News View presents an image slider and clock in the upper left corner, creating an engaging user experience.
Image "News" Slider: The News View incorporates an image slider that displays a series of images with description to simulate news. Users can navigate through the images using intuitive buttons.

Tags Bar: The cosmetic "tags" bar provides a visual representation of tags associated with the content. (Note: This feature is currently under development and may not be fully functional.)
